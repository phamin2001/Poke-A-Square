- The objective of our game is to click on as many blue squares as possible during the alloted time

### User Stories/game logic

-  When the user clicks begin the timer should start, and the squares should populate with a random color

-  When the use clicks on a color the color should disapear, and score should be added or subtracted

- When the round is over the scores round and time should be updated and the user should be able to start again with increased difficulty. 


### Making Branches

- Create a new branch ```git checkout -b branchName```
- switching branches (always add & commit before switching) ```git checkout branchName```
- Merging branches, taking the contents of one branch and adding them to another ```git merge branchName``` 
from the branch you want to add code to, you merge in the corresponding branch

### Workflow

1. git checkout -b createSquares
2. write your code
3. git add & commit your code, then you are free to change back to the master branch, were you will be able to pull down the instructors code at anytime.
